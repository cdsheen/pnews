 * 
 * uuencode
 * 
 * Unix program for encoding binary data as ASCII. Uuencode was originally used
 * with uucp to transfer binary files over serial lines which did not
 * preserve the top bit of characters but is now used for sending binary
 * files by e-mail and posting to Usenet newsgroups etc. The program uudecode
 * reverses the effect of uuencode, recreating the original binary file
 * exactly.
 * 
 * Uuencoded data starts with a line of the form
 * 
 * begin <mode> <file>
 * 
 * 
 * where <mode> is the files read/write/execute permissions as three octal
 * digits and <file> is the name to be used when recreating the binary data.
 * 
 * Uuencode repeatedly takes in a group of three bytes, adding trailing zeros if
 * there are less than three bytes left. These 24 bits are split into four
 * groups of six which are treated as numbers between 0 and 63. Decimal 32 is
 * added to each number and they are ouput as ASCII characters which will lie
 * in the range 32 (space) to 32+63 = 95 (underscore). Each group of sixty
 * ouptut characters (corresponding to 45 input bytes) is output as a
 * separate line preceded by an 'M' (ASCII code 77 = 32+45). At the end of
 * the input, if there are N output characters left after the last group of
 * sixty and N>0 then they will be preceded by the character whose code is
 * 32+N. Finally, a line containing just a single space is output, followed
 * by one containing just "end".
 * 
 * Sometimes each data line has an extra dummy character added to avoid problems
 * which mailers that strip trailing spaces. These characters are ignored by
 * uudecode.
 * 
 * Despite using this limited range of characters, there are still some problems
 * encountered when uuencoded data passes through certain old computers. The
 * worst offenders are computers using non-ASCII character sets such as
 * EBCDIC.
